## How to use?
You can configure which vehicles can tow other vehicles, 
you can also lock the functionality to specific jobs instead of everyone being able to tow a vehicle.

To tow a vehicle, you need to target the vehicle you want to attach, set the vehicle as tow target,
then target the 'vehicle' (or trailer) you want to tow the vehicle on and attach the vehicle.

To drop a vehicle simply target the vehicle/trailer and select detach.
